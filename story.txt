Story

Once upon a time, there was a boy named Mat, a sister named Jasmine, and Mat's best friend, Robert.
Mat and Robert had a big disagreement.
It was about which school subject was the best one.
Mat thought that Math was the best school subject.
However, Robert believed that Science was the best.
They wouldn't get anywhere if they kept on arguing, so Jasmine stepped in.
